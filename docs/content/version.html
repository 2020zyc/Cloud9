<h2>Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>: What Hadoop version should I use?</h2>

<p>What Hadoop version should I use?  I get this question a lot... and
the answer is (as you might expect): <i>it depends</i>.
Unfortunately, in many cases this is a damned if you do, damned if you
don't decision.  Take your chances with new unknown bugs or continue
working around known ones?  But if you never upgrade you'll never get
to take advantage of new features...</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines that may be helpful, but first, a
clarification on terminology.  Hadoop releases are currently numbered
0.<i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>, where <i>X</i> is usually known as the major
release, and <i>Y</i> is usually known as the minor release.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Hadoop 0.18.3 is currently considered the "stable release".
  Stability, however, is relative.  You might be interested
  in <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop">Cloudera's
  distribution</a>.</li>

  <li>Hadoop 0.19.X is a complete disaster&mdash;avoid at all costs.
  This release introduced HDFS file append, a very complex feature
  that require significant changes to the code base.  It was so buggy
  that the developers had to disable the feature in a subsequent minor
  release.</li>

  <li>Hadoop 0.20.0 is the latest release, available on April 22,
  2009.  This release is still in it's shakeout period, but things
  look promising from a stability point of view.  There are
  non-trivial API changes in 0.20.0, so upgrading to this version will
  require changes to existing code.</li>

</ul>

<p>In general, nearly all initial major releases (i.e., 0.<i>X</i>.0)
are buggy.  These bugs are usually fixed in subsequent minor releases.
Therefore, it is probably a good idea to wait until 0.20.1 before
upgrading... let others debug the release first!  However, since
upgrading to 0.20 will require code changes, I expect that many will
remain with 0.18.3 for a while.</p>

<p>Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> is currently written for 0.17.2,
which is included in <code>hadoop/</code>.  It's a bit behind, because
the clusters that Maryland uses are still running that release.
However, since there are no major API changes from 0.17 to 0.18, the
entire code base should run fine with 0.18.3 (for example, on
EC2).</p>
