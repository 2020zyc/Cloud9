<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>These instructions are intended help you get onto the Google/IBM
Hadoop cluster, available via the <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf08560/nsf08560.htm">NSF CLuE
program</a> and the <a
href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/let-thousand-servers-bloom.html">Google/IBM
Academic Cloud Computing Initiative (ACCI)</a> to University of
Maryland students who are working in the context of those two
projects.</p>

<p>In these instructions, I will refer to the following machines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GATEWAY: the gateway machine</li>
  <li>JOBTRACKER: the node that runs the jobtracker</li>
  <li>NAMENODE: the HDFS name node</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, replace the references with the actual IP addresses
of the machines (which you should have received separately).  I am not
publishing the IP addresses of these machines as a security
measure.</p>

<h3>1. Unpack Hadoop</h3>

<p>Unpack Hadoop on your local machine.  The release running on the
cluster is 0.17.2, a copy of which is located
in <code>umd-hadoop-core/hadoop/</code>, the core distribution of
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>.  Unpack the
tarball <code>hadoop-0.17.2.tar.gz</code>.</p>

<h3>2. Site up configuration files</h3>

<p>On your local machine, open up <code>hadoop-site.xml</code>
in <code>hadoop-0.17.2/conf</code> and add the following
properties:</p>

<pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;hdfs://NAMENODE:9000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;mapred.job.tracker&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;JOBTRACKER:9001&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.rpc.socket.factory.class.default&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.net.SocksSocketFactory&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.socks.server&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;localhost:6789&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hadoop.tmp.dir&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/tmp/hadoop&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

</pre>

<p>Make sure you substitute the actual IP address for NAMENODE and
JOBTRACKER.</p>

<h3>3. Open up a SOCKS proxy</h3>

<p>On your local machine, open up a shell and invoke the following
command:</p>

<pre>
ssh -D 6789 username@GATEWAY
</pre>

<p>Make sure you substitute your real username and the actual IP
address for GATEWAY.  Enter your password and log in when
prompted.</p>

<p>Here, I'm assuming that you have ssh installed.  In Windows, your
best bet is to install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>; ssh
isn't installed by default, so you'll have to manually specify the
package.</p>

<h3>4. Test drive the cluster</h3>

<p>With the above steps and bit of luck, you should be able to access
the Hadoop cluster from your local machine!  Basically, you've set up
a direct connection to the Hadoop cluster via a SOCKS proxy.</p>

<p>Try things out with a simple command (from your local machine):</p>

<pre>
hadoop dfs -ls /
</pre>

<p>Also, try submitting a job by running the pi demo:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar hadoop-0.17.2-examples.jar pi 10 100
</pre>

<p>If this works, then you're basically all set!</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Hadoop only works with SOCKS v5, so if you have an
older version of ssh that only supports SOCKS v4, then you should
upgrade (or get your admin to).  This is a known problem with CLIP
machines (as of September 2008)!  This issue manifests in really
unhelpful error messages.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Windows users under Cygwin might get the following
error:</p>

<pre>
javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Login failed: Expect one token as the result of whoami: Jimmy Lin
</pre>

<p>The reason for this is that Cygwin uses your Windows username when
trying to connect to the cluster, which may have a space in it, e.g.,
"Jimmy Lin" (which causes the above login error).  To fix this, edit
<code>/etc/password</code>, which in actuality would
be <code>c:\cygwin\etc\password</code> if your Cygwin install path
was <code>c:\cygwin\</code>.  Find the entry for your username and
remove the space (first field); following standard conventions I also
like to downcase my entire username, e.g., "jimmylin".  While you're
at it you might want to rename your home directory also (second to
last field).</p>

<h3>5. Connect to the webapps</h3>

<p>To access the jobtracker Webapp, you'll have to get your browser to
use the SOCKS proxy.  The preferred solution is FoxyProxy for Firefox.
First, download and install
FoxyProxy <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">from this link</a>.
Then, take the following steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Select menu item "Tools" &gt; "FoxyProxy" &gt; "Options".</li>

<li>Click "Add New Proxy".</li>

<li>In "General" tab, make sure the proxy is enabled.  Give it a name,
e.g., "Google/IBM cluster"</li>

<li>In "Proxy Details" tab, select "Manual Proxy Configuration", enter
"127.0.0.1" for "Host Name", 6789 for "Port", check "SOCKS Proxy?",
and make sure "SOCKS v5" is selected.</li>

<li>In "Patterns" tab, click "Add New Pattern".  Given it a name
(e.g., "default"), and enter the pattern "http://JOBTRACKER:*/*".
Substitute the real IP address.</li>

<li>You might want to add a similar pattern for accessing the HDFS
Webapp on "http://NAMENODE:*/*", or generalize the two into a single
pattern.  Say the IP address is aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, you might want to
enter a pattern like "http://aaa.bbb.*.*:*/*".  Also, to access the
task logs, you'll need to add a pattern along the lines of
"http://xen*:*/*".</li>

<li>Click "OK" to finish setting up the proxy.</li>

<li>Back in FoxyProxy Options, change "Mode" to "Use proxies based on
their pre-defined patterns and priorities".  Click "Close" to finish
up.</li>

</ol>

<p>If you navigate to <code>http://JOBTRACKER:50030/</code> in your
browser, you should be able to access the jobtracker!</p>

<h3>6. Accessing Task Logs</h3>

<p>You'll want to access the task logs on the individual cluster
workers for debugging, but the problem is that the Webapp gives you
URLs that contain references to Xen virtual machines, something
like <code>http://xenhost-XXXXXXXXXXXX-X:50060/tasklog...</code>,
which isn't very helpful because you need the actual IP addresses of
the individual workers.  The easiest solution is to hack your hosts
file.</p>

<p>Email me or the admins for the Xen host to IP mappings (I'm not
posting publicly for obvious security reasons).  Add them to your
hosts file, the location of which varies by operating system:
usually <code>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\</code> for Windows
NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7, and <code>/etc/</code> for Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems.  For more information, consult this
helpful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>

<p>And that's it!  You should now be able to access the task logs.  If
you still can't, go back to Step 6 in the previous section: one common
problem is that your FoxyProxy pattern doesn't capture the URL and
direct connections through the proxy.</p>

<p>There is, however, one minor issue with hacking the hosts
file... which is that you'll need root privileges.  If for whatever
reason you don't have root access, there is another solution: a
Firefox plugin
called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6510">FoxReplace</a>
nicely solves the problem.  It automatically replaces text in URLs, so
we just need to give it a Xen host to IP mapping.  Go ahead and
download the plugin.  Email me for the mappings XML file.</p>

<p>Once you have FoxReplace installed, go through the following steps:

<ol>

  <li>Select menu item "Tools" &gt; "FoxReplace" &gt; "FoxReplace options...".</li>

  <li>Click "Import" and load the XML mappings file you get from me.</li>

  <li>Make sure "Auto-replace on page load" is checked.</li>

  <li>Click "OK" to finish.</li>

</ol>

<p>And that should do it!</p>
