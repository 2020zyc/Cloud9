<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In Hadoop, the two basic data types are:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>WritableComparable</code> is the base interface
  for keys, and</li>

  <li><code>Writable</code> is the base class interface for
  values.</li>

</ul>

<p>Classes implementing the above two interfaces provide your basic
primitives:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>IntWriteable</code> (ints),</li>
  <li><code>Text</code> (strings),</li>
  <li><code>BytesWritable</code> (raw bytes),</li>
  <li>etc.</li>

</ul>

<p>So what do you do when you need to work with more complex data
types?  Well, here are your options:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b><a href="#option1">Option 1</a></b>: hack it &mdash; treat
  everything as text, parse it manually (this gets ugly real
  quick).</li>

  <li><b><a href="#option2">Option 2</a></b>: use the
  Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> bindings for JSON &mdash; easy to
  use, but runs pretty slow.</li>

  <li><b><a href="#option3">Option 3</a></b>: use the
  Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> Tuple library &mdash; runs faster
  than using JSON.</li>

  <li><b><a href="#option4">Option 4</a></b>: roll your own custom
  data type &mdash; runs much faster (up to an order of magnitude),
  but I wouldn't recommend this if you're just starting out since it
  requires writing more code.</li>

  <li><b><a href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></b>: other things to
  look at.</li>

</ul>

<p>At the very end, I'm going to discuss some <a
href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> comparing options 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<h3><a name="option1">Option 1: Hack it yourself</a></h3>

<p>The simplest way to represent complex data is to encode it
into <code>Text</code>.  For example, you could represent lists as
comma delimited values.  Once you read the text (e.g., in a mapper),
split the string on commas and reconstruct the individual list
elements.  Before emitting a key or a value, encode the list back into
Text in the same way.  The downside of this technique, of course, is
an ugly mess.  This is a quick way to get started with Hadoop, but
you'll want to quickly move past this phase.</p>

<h3><a name="option2">Option 2: JSON bindings in Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a></h3>

<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data
interchange format for representing simple data structures.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">Wikipedia article
about JSON</a> and <a href="http://www.json.org/">json.org</a> are
good places for more information.  The basic idea is to use JSON
objects as complex data structure inside Hadoop.  Included with
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>
is <a href="http://www.json.org/java/index.html">Java support for JSON</a>
in the <code>org.json</code> package.</p>

<p>As an example, the following JSON object:</p>

<pre>
 {
     "firstName": "John",
     "lastName": "Smith",
     "address": {
         "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
         "city": "New York",
         "state": "NY",
         "postalCode": 10021
     },
     "phoneNumbers": [
         "212 555-1234",
         "646 555-4567"
     ]
 }
</pre>

<p>Can be built with the following code snippet:</p>

<pre>
JSONObject obj = new JSONObject();

obj.put("firstName", "John");
obj.put("lastName", "Smith");
		 
JSONObject address = new JSONObject();
address.put("streetAddress", "21 2nd Street");
address.put("city", "New York");
address.put("state", "NY");
address.put("postalCode", 10021);

JSONArray phoneNumbers = new JSONArray();
phoneNumbers.put("212 555-1234");
phoneNumbers.put("646 555-4567");

obj.put("address", address);
obj.put("phoneNumbers", phoneNumbers);
</pre>

<p>Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> provides support for JSON
via <a href="../api/edu/umd/cloud9/io/JSONObjectWritable.html"><code>JSONObjectWritable</code></a>,
which extends <code>JSONObject</code> to provide serialization and
deserialization capabilities.
See <a href="../../../umd-hadoop-core/src/edu/umd/cloud9/demo/DemoWordCondProbJSON.java"><code>DemoWordCondProbJSON.java</code></a>
for an example of using JSON objects as keys in Hadoop, for computing
conditional probabilities.</p>

<p>One caveat is that <code>JSONObjectWritable</code>
implements <code>Writable</code>,
not <code>WriteableComparable</code>: this is because JSON objects, in
general, do not have a natural sort order.  However, keys for
MapReduce jobs in Hadoop need to
implement <code>WritableComparable</code>: the solution is to
extend <code>JSONObjectWritable</code> to
implement <code>WritableComparable</code> and define your own custom
comparator:</p>

<pre>
public class MyJSONObject extends JSONObjectWritable implements WritableComparable {
    public int compareTo(Object obj) {
        ....
    }
}
</pre>

<p>If your custom JSON Object is defined as an inner class, remember
to declare it <b><code>static</code></b> so the Hadoop runtime is able
to instantiate objects independent of an enclosing instance of the
outer class.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> You will also want to
override <code>hashCode()</code> so that relevant JSON objects get
sent to the same reducer.  Or else write a
custom <code>Partitioner</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="option3">Option 3: Tuple library in Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a></h3>

<p>See <a href="../../../umd-hadoop-core/src/edu/umd/cloud9/demo/DemoWordCondProbTuple.java"><code>DemoWordCountTuple.java</code></a>
for a demo of the Tuple class used as an intermediate key in a
MapReduce job.</p>

<p>The structure of each tuple is dictated by a schema.  Schemas are
defined by the <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cloud9/io/Schema.html"><code>Schema</code></a>
class.  Here a sample code fragment of how a schema is defined:</p>

<pre>
public static final Schema MYSCHEMA = new Schema();
static {
    MYSCHEMA.addField("token", String.class, "");
    MYSCHEMA.addField("int", Integer.class, new Integer(1));
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>addField</code> method allows you to insert a field and
specify default values.  The following are valid field types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Java primitives: Boolean, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String</li>
  <li>Classes that implement Writable</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a schema has been defined, tuples can be instantiated in one
of two ways:</p>

<pre>
// method 1: new Tuple with default values
Tuple tuple1 = MYSCHEMA.instantiate();

// method 2: new Tuple with specified values
Tuple tuple2 = MYSCHEMA.instantiate("test", 2);
</pre>

<p>Calling the <code>instantiate()</code> method without any
parameters creates a new <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cloud9/io/Tuple.html"><code>Tuple</code></a> with
default values.  Alternatively, you can directly specify the values of
each field using <code>instantiate(Object...)</code>, the overloaded
method that takes a variable number of Objects as parameters.</p>

<p>Once a tuple is created, fields can be modified using the
<code>set</code> method; field values can be retrieved using the
<code>get</code> method.  You can refer to a field by its integer
index position, or by its field name: the first is faster, but the
second makes code more readable.</p>

<p>Since a Tuple implements WritableComparable, it can be used
directly in Hadoop without any effort.  The class automatically takes
care of serializing and deserializing the object.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Tuple class is its ability to store special
symbols.  Each field in the Tuple can either hold an Object of the
type defined by its Schema, or a special symbol String.  The method
<code>containsSymbol</code> can be used to check if a field contains a
special symbol. If the field contains a special symbol,
<code>get</code> will return <code>null</code>. If the field does not
contain a special symbol, <code>getSymbol</code> will return
<code>null</code>.</p>

<p>What's the use of this feature?  Say you had tuples that
represented <code>count(a,b)</code>, where <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> are tokens you observe (i.e., these are the joint
counts). There is often a need to compute <code>count(a,*)</code>,
which corresponds to the marginal count.  In this case, you can use a
special symbol to represent the <code>*</code>, and distinguish it
from the lexical token '<code>*</code>' (where asterisks actually
appeared as tokens).  Refer to
<code>edu.umd.cloud9.demo.DemoWordCondProbTuple</code> for a
well-commented basic demo that uses this special symbol feature.</p>

<p>Also of interest
is <a href="../api/edu/umd/cloud9/io/ArrayListWritable.html"><code>ArrayListWritable</code></a>,
which provides a Hadoop data type for storing a list of
homogeneous <code>Writable</code> elements.  This class, combined
with <code>Tuple</code>, allows you to define arbitrarily complex data
structures.</p>

<!--h4>Design Rationale</h4>

<p>In adopting the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">factory
pattern</a> for the creation of tuples from the Schema class,
verbosity was traded for transparency and readability.  Using factory
methods for instantiation may be cumbersome at times, but one is
forced to develop explicit schemas that appropriately model the data.
Furthermore, the current design allows fields to be referenced by
descriptive names, which improves program readability, at the expense
of larger serialized objects (since field names need to be stored with
the tuples).</p>

<p>Donald Knuth's famous quote, "premature optimization is the root of
all evil" (Knuth, 1974), should be kept in mind when considering the
current implementation of the Tuple class.  For example, the class
uses a reasonable, but not particularly clever or optimized algorithm
for serialization and deserialization.  But that's not the point.  We
need to develop experience with a broad range of usage scenarios
before optimization should be undertaken.</p-->

<h3><a name="option4">Option 4: Custom types</a></h3>

<p>Finally, you can roll out your own custom data type by coding it
from scratch.  For rapid prototyping, this may be too slow; but once
you know what you want, you'll probably want to write custom data
types.</p>

<p>For <code>Writable</code>, you'll need to implement these
two methods:</p>

<ul>

  <li>public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException</li>
  <li>public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException</li>

</ul>

<p>They tell the object how to serialize and deserialize itself.  In
addition, make sure you have defined a zero argument constructor:
that's how the runtime creates objects of the type.  Finally, make
sure that <code>readFields</code> "resets" the object every time it is
called: the Hadoop runtime will reuse objects whenever possible, which
means that <code>readFields</code> will be called repeatedly.  Make
sure the state of the object is cleared before deserialization.</p>

<p><code>WritableComparable</code> is a sub-interface
of <code>Writable</code>, so in addition to everything above, you'll
need to implement <code>compareTo</code>, which defines the sort order
of the object.</p>


<h3><a name="benchmarks">Benchmarks</a></h3>

<p>Ah, so why so many options?  It all boils down to a speed versus
convenience tradeoff.  JSON (Option 2) and the tuple facilities in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> (Option 3) are relatively easy to get
started with, but run slow.  Writing custom types will make your code
run <i>much</i> faster, but well... you have to write more code (and
tweaking the code can be a pain if you don't quite have the data
structure right the first time).  So, I would suggest rapid
prototyping in JSON or the tuple facilities; write custom types when
you finally got your algorithm nailed down.</p>

<p>As a reference, here are some benchmarks comparing options 2, 3,
and 4.  The "complex" data structure is pretty simple: just a pair of
integers.  The sort order is also pretty straightforward: sort by
first number, then by second number.  I compared three different
data types:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="../api/edu/umd/cloud9/io/PairOfInts.html"><code>PairOfInts</code></a></li>
<li>a Tuple with two fields</li>
<li>a JSON object with two fields</li>

</ul>

<p>I ran three different tasks:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Creating 2 million new objects.  Each is populated with two
  random numbers between 0 and 1000.  All objects are added to an
  ArrayList.</li>

  <li>Cloning all 2 million objects.  All new objects are added to
  another ArrayList.</li>

  <li>Sorting the second ArrayList</li>

</ul>

<p>And here are the results (all in seconds):</p>

<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><td></td><td width="90"><b>PairOfInts</b></td><td width="90"><b>Tuple</b></td><td width="90"><b>JSON</b></td></tr>

<tr><td>Creating objects</td><td>0.609</td><td>3.319</td><td>4.472</td></tr>

<tr><td>Cloning objects</td><td>0.576</td><td>2.303</td><td>4.972</td></tr>

<tr><td>Sorting list</td><td>1.681</td><td>7.591</td><td>11.644</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Times were arrived at by taking the average of 10 trials.
Experiments were conducted on Aug 6, 2008 on a 2.6GHz MacBook Pro
running Windows XP and Cygwin.  (Yes, yes, I know its blasphemous to
run XP on a MBP: I actually dual-boot... just happened to be in
Windows while running these experiments.) </p>

<p>You may wonder, why is JSON so slow?  The reason is that in the
current implementation provided by <code>org.json</code>, the
underlying implementation of JSONObject uses HashMaps.  Tuple uses
arrays.  Array accesses are much much faster than looking up keys in a
hash.</p>

<p>If you're curious, you can run these benchmarks yourself: see code
in the <code>edu.umd.cloud9.io</code> package.</p>

<p>Other things you might want to look at:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Hadoop's record I/O classes, in
  <code>org.apache.hadoop.record</code>.  The downside is that it's a
  relatively heavyweight implementation, since you must first define
  record types in a data description language (DDL), and then use
  Hadoop's translator to automatically generate code.</li>
