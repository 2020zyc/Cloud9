<h2>Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>: Exercises: Boolean retrieval</h2>

<p>by Jimmy Lin</p>

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">

</p>

<div class="main">

<p>Write a Boolean retrieval engine that uses the index created in the
<a href="indexer.html">inverted index construction</a> exercise.  Your
retrieval engine should be able to handle complex Boolean queries of
the following form:</p>

<pre>
( slings AND arrows ) OR ( mortal AND coil )
( et AND tu AND brute )
</pre>

<p>Your system will need to parse nested Boolean queries.  To make
query processing simpler, you can choose the notation in which the
queries are
expressed: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix
notation</a> (as above)
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">prefix
notation</a>, e.g., "(AND slings arrows)".  If you want to be
particularly clever, write a query parser
for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">reverse
polish notation</a>&mdash;it has many advantages, one of which is that
all expressions can be unambiguously interpreted without
parentheses.</p>

<p>As with previous exercises, use the sample input included in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>, <a href="../../sample-input/bible+shakes.nopunc">the
Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare</a>.  As a bare minimum,
your Boolean retrieval engine must be able to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Process arbitrarily complex, nested queries, implementing both
  the "AND" and "OR" operators.</li>

  <li>Return the docno and full text of the lines from the sample
  collection that matches the query.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, in response to the query "outrageous AND fortune",
your retrieval engine should return something like:</p>

<pre>
4442172  the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
</pre>

<p>To give another example, in response to the query "white AND rose",
your retrieval engine should return something like:</p>

<pre>
7841087  from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
7841354  i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
7841879  giving my verdict on the white rose side
7841972  lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
7842315  in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
7842458  shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
7845524  shall send between the red rose and the white
8237199  until the white rose that i wear be dyed
8275306  the red rose and the white are on his face
9067070  we will unite the white rose and the red
</pre>

<p>Once you have the Boolean search engine working, try out these
sample queries:</p>

<pre>
means AND deceit
(white OR red ) AND rose AND pluck
(unhappy OR outrageous OR (good AND your)) AND fortune
</pre>

<h3>Practical Tips</h3>

<p>This exercise is meant to be completed outside of Hadoop.  I would
recommend the following steps:</p>

<ol>

 <li>Build your inverted index in Hadoop, as per
 the <a href="indexer.html">inverted index construction</a> exercise.
 If you set the number of reducers to one, all the postings will be
 written to a single file.  This will make the index easier to
 manipulate.  Obviously, this isn't a scalable solution, but it will
 suffice for this exercise.</li>

 <li>Retrieve your index from HDFS with the <code>hadoop dfs
 -get</code> command.  For more details, see
 this <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/r0.17.0/hdfs_shell.html">guide
 on Hadoop Shell commands</a>.</li>

 <li>Scp your inverted index from the Hadoop cluster onto your local
 machine.</li>

</ol>

<p>If you haven't already, this exercise may be a good opportunity to
learn about different output formats.  An <code>OutputFormat</code>
(see Hadoop API) describes how output key-value pairs are written to
HDFS.  By default, Hadoop uses <code>TextOutputFormat</code>, which
writes out the key-value pairs in human-readable text format.  This is
good for you, but can be annoying if you want to further manipulate
the output programmatically&mdash;since you'll have the read in the text
file and parse the key-value pairs back into Java objects.  As an
alternative, you might want to
consider <code>SequenceFileOutputFormat</code>; you can specify that
format with a method in <code>JobConf</code>:</p>

<pre>
conf.setOutputFormat(SequenceFileOutputFormat.class);
</pre>

<p>If you do this, the output of your MapReduce jobs will be stored in
one or more <code>SequenceFiles</code>.  The advantage
of <code>SequenceFiles</code> is that they store key-value pairs in a
machine-readable format, i.e., as serialized byte representations of
the Java objects (not human readable, but can be programmatically
manipulated quite easily).  The <code>SequenceFile</code> API provides
methods for reading key-value pairs&mdash;saving you the effort of
having to manually parse plain text files.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, you might also want to take a look
at <code>MapFileOutputFormat</code>, which writes the output key-value
pairs to... as you've guessed, <code>MapFiles</code>!  These files
have the additional advantage of supporting random access to the keys.
Once again, see the API for details.</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>Some optional features you might want to consider implementing
are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Support for the boolean "NOT" operator.  Or try the "AND-NOT"
  operator, which is a bit easier.  The query "(a AND-NOT b)"
  retrieves documents that contain a, but not b.</li>

  <li>Ordering of retrieved documents based on the number of matching
  terms (or something similarly sensical).  For example, given the
  query "(a AND b)", lines that have four occurrences of the query
  terms should be place ahead of lines that have three occurrences of
  the query terms.</li>

</ul>
