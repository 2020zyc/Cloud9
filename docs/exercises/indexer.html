<div class="main">

<p>In this exercise, you'll be creating an <i>inverted index</i>.  An
inverted index is a data structure common to nearly all information
retrieval systems.  Let us consider the following famous lines from
Shakespeare's <i>Merchants of Venice</i>:</p>

<pre>
1: if you prick us do we not bleed
2: if you tickle us do we not laugh 
3: if you poison us do we not die and 
4: if you wrong us shall we not revenge
</pre>

<p>An inverted index consists of a collection of postings lists, one
associated with each unique term in the collection.  Each postings
list consists of a number of individual postings.  Each posting holds
a document identifier (docno) and the frequency (i.e., count) of the
term in that document.</p>

<p>Let's treat each line in the above sample data as if it were a
"document".  The complete inverted index would look something like
this:</p>

<pre>
and     : 1 : (3, 1)
bleed   : 1 : (1, 1)
die     : 1 : (3, 1)
do      : 3 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)
if      : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
laugh   : 1 : (2, 1)
not     : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
poison  : 1 : (3, 1)
prick   : 1 : (1, 1)
revenge : 1 : (4, 1)
shall   : 1 : (4, 1)
tickle  : 1 : (2, 1)
us      : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
we      : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
wrong   : 1 : (4, 1)
you     : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
</pre>

<p>As you can see, we have a postings list for each word that appears
in the collection.  Let us look at the postings list corresponding to
the term <i>if</i> in a bit more detail:</p>

<pre>
if      : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
</pre>

<p>The number directly after the term is its <i>document frequency</i>
or <i>df</i> for short.  The <i>df</i> specifies the number of
documents that contain this term.  Since <i>if</i> appears in all four
documents, its <i>df</i> is 4.  Although the <i>df</i> can be easily
reconstructed by counting the number of postings, it is often
explicitly stored in the inverted index.  The postings list contains a
number of postings, each of which is a (<i>docno</i>, <i>tf</i>)
tuple.  The <i>docno</i> is simply a unique identifier for the
document (one through four, in this case).  The <i>tf</i>, which
stands for <i>term frequency</i>, is the number of times the term
appears in the document.  The term
<i>if</i> appears once in every document.  Typically, postings are
sorted by ascending docno (as shown above). </p>

<p><b>Your task:</b> write a MapReduce program that builds an inverted
index (as described above).  Each postings list should explicitly
store the <i>df</i>, as well as all the individual postings.  Postings
should be sorted by ascending docno (postings corresponding to smaller
docnos should precede postings corresponding to larger docnos).</p>

<p>Run the inverted indexer on the sample input included in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>, <a
href="../../data/bible+shakes.nopunc.gz">the Bible and the complete
works of Shakespeare</a>.  As with the above case, treat each line as
if it were an individual "document".  When you map over a plain text
file using TextInputFormat in Hadoop, the key passed to the mapper
contains the byte offset of the line from the beginning of the file,
while the value contains the text of the line.  Use this offset value
as the unique docno.  As part of this exercise you'll also need to
write a utility (outside MapReduce) that takes a given docno (i.e.,
the byte offset) and returns the associated line.</p>

<p>Questions to answer:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Look up the postings corresponding to the term "starcross'd".
  There should only be one line in the entire collection that contains
  the term.  What is that line?  What's its docno (i.e., byte
  offset)?</li>

  <li>Look up the postings corresponding to the term "gold".  Generate
  a histogram of <i>tf</i> values.  That is, in how many lines does
  "gold" appear once, twice, three times, etc.?</li>

  <li>Do the same for the terms "silver" and "bronze".</li>

</ol>

<h3>Practical Tips</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you'll have to create and manipulate postings
lists, which are complex objects that have their own internal
structure.  Let's consider this term and its associated postings list
as an example:</p>

<pre>
if      : 4 : (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
</pre>

<p>You have three choices to represent postings lists.  First, you can
encode them as Java strings wrapped inside Hadoop Text objects.  The
string format might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
4:1,1:2,1:3,1:4,1
</pre>

<p>The downside is that when manipulating postings, you'll have to do
a lot of string-based operations (e.g., splits).  This approach will
work, but it's pretty ugly.</p>

<p>The second approach is to write your own custom Writable.  The
third is to reuse Writables that are in
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup>.  You'll want to look in the
edu.umd.cloud9.io package if you decide to go this route.</p>

<p>If you decide to adopt the second or third option, this exercise is
a good opportunity to learn about different output formats.  An
OutputFormat (see Hadoop API) describes how output key-value pairs are
written to HDFS.  By default, Hadoop uses TextOutputFormat, which
writes out the key-value pairs in human-readable text format.  This is
good for you, but can be annoying if you want to further manipulate
the output programmatically&mdash;since you'll have the read in the
text file and parse the key-value pairs back into Java objects (even
if you have your own custom Writables).  As an alternative, you might
want to consider SequenceFileOutputFormat.  You can specify that
format with a method in JobConf:</p>

<pre>
conf.setOutputFormat(SequenceFileOutputFormat.class);
</pre>

<p>If you do this, the output of your MapReduce job will be stored in
one or more SequenceFiles.  The advantage of SequenceFiles is that
they store key-value pairs in a machine-readable format, i.e., as
serialized byte representations of the Java objects (not human
readable, but can be programmatically manipulated quite easily).  The
SequenceFile API provides methods for reading key-value
pairs&mdash;saving you the effort of having to manually parse plain
text files.  Of course, SequenceFiles aren't very useful if you are
using Text objects as output values.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, you might also want to take a look at
MapFileOutputFormat, which writes the output key-value pairs to... as
you've guessed, MapFiles!  These files have the additional advantage
of supporting random access to the keys.  Once again, see the API for
details.</p>
